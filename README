# Config for the fro-dux v1

This config is based on [andrewjrae's ZMK config and respective shield](https://github.com/andrewjrae/zmk-config) for the [rae-dux](https://github.com/andrewjrae/rae-dux) of which the fro-dux is based on.

I mainly updated the workflow, because it was already two years old and forking the original project did not really work.

My config is based on the [urob's layout](https://github.com/urob/zmk-config) but I did not include all features which makes the config a bit more understandable for a noob like me :) I chose this over the miryoku approach because it relies heavily on combos; and I love it. Still under development; let's see with what I end up with...
